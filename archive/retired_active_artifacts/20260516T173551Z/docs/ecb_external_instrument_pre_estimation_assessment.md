# ECB External-Instrument Pre-Estimation Assessment

Date: 2026-05-15

This memo closes the external-instrument preparation stage for the EU/DE thesis repository. It does not estimate LP-IV responses or write final thesis conclusions.

## Source and Coverage

- Working factor vintage: ABGMR `2025-10-30`.
- Event coverage after cleaning: 244 event rows from 2002-01-03 to 2025-10-30.
- Quarterly export coverage: 96 quarters, with 0 no-event quarters.
- ECB EA-MPD validation gap: `2008-10-08,2008-11-06`.
- Post-2014 QE factor coverage: 100.0%.
- PEPP emergency 2020-03-18 in source event list: `review`. This is flagged because EA-MPD/ABGMR factors do not necessarily include every unscheduled emergency announcement.

## 1. Is the instrument strong enough?

Source-audit timing-factor first-stage screen for `timing_factor_quarterly_sum`:

- Wu-Xia shadow-rate change: F=0.02, partial R2=0.000, coef=0.0029, p=0.894, weak_instrument_warning_below_rule_of_thumb_10
- ECB asset log growth: F=1.26, partial R2=0.015, coef=-0.0027, p=0.265, weak_instrument_warning_below_rule_of_thumb_10
- DFR change: F=0.08, partial R2=0.001, coef=0.0034, p=0.784, weak_instrument_warning_below_rule_of_thumb_10

Current LP-IV baseline: `target_factor_market_magnitude_weighted_quarterly_sum` against `d_ecb_assets_ea_qavg`. The timing-factor rows above are source diagnostics only and are not a baseline branch.

## 2. Is quarterly aggregation defensible?

Yes, the baseline `quarterly_sum` rule is defensible for the thesis design. ECB surprises are high-frequency news-flow shocks. Multiple meetings in a quarter represent cumulative policy-information arrivals, so summing is the most natural quarterly mapping. The pipeline also exports `quarterly_mean`, `absolute_sum`, and `signed_cumulative` variants to test whether downstream conclusions depend on meeting density, sign, or cumulative-news treatment.

## 3. Does identification depend excessively on crisis periods?

For the source-audit timing factor, crisis regimes account for 49.5% of total absolute quarterly surprise mass. The top decile of absolute timing surprises accounts for 42.1% of total absolute mass. Outlier quarters with |z| >= 3: `2006Q2,2008Q2,2009Q3,2011Q3`.

This means crisis leverage must be reported explicitly in the LP-IV diagnostics stage. The current pipeline generates regime concentration, rolling variance, and quarter-density diagnostics before estimation.

## 4. Is the baseline stable across QE, COVID, and tightening?

The source covers the QE era, COVID period, and 2022 tightening transition. QE factors are populated after 2014, and the 2022H2 tightening events are present. The COVID emergency-announcement audit is cautious because the PEPP emergency date is not present in the ABGMR factor event list.

The lightweight JK-style sign screen is preserved as an interpretation layer. It flags potential central-bank information events from rate/equity comovement but is not used as the baseline identification.

## 5. Final pre-estimation recommendation

- Official LP-IV baseline instrument: `target_factor_market_magnitude_weighted_quarterly_sum`.
- Diagnostic exports: weighted shocks, signed cumulative variants, quarterly means, and monthly bridge variants remain available for audit context only.
- Excluded from baseline: simultaneous multi-factor instruments, full Jarocinski-Karadi replication, and DAX as a baseline response.

Active stage: frozen LP-IV thesis delivery with first-stage, rolling, regime, horizon, and weak-IV diagnostics.
