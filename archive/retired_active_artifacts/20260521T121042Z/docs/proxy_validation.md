# Proxy Validation

Date: 2026-05-16

This document records the final monthly proxy tournament. The rule is conservative: no quarterly housing or compensation series is interpolated into fake monthly observations. A proxy is usable only if it is a real monthly source series and its limitation is visible in the table below.

## Canonical Selections

| compensation | ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy | ECB Wage Tracker excluding one-off payments, real | Monthly real negotiated wage pressure excluding one-off payments. | ECB EWT | 2013-01-31 | 2025-10-31 | 1.000 | 0.729 | 1.000 | stable_to_info_screen | 120 |
| housing | ecb_house_purchase_growth_yoy | ECB lending for house purchase, annual growth | Monthly growth in MFI loans for house purchase; housing-finance transmission. | ECB BSI | 2005-01-31 | 2025-10-31 | 1.000 | 0.018 | 1.000 | stable_to_info_screen | 119 |

## Accepted Proxies

| side | role | variable | label | conceptual_object | source | observations | monthly_continuity | quarterly_target_correlation | decision_reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| compensation | canonical | ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy | ECB Wage Tracker excluding one-off payments, real | Monthly real negotiated wage pressure excluding one-off payments. | ECB EWT | 154 | 1.000 | 0.729 | Best monthly compensation-side proxy for persistent real negotiated wage pressure; not actual compensation per employee. |
| compensation | diagnostic | ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy_momentum_3m | ECB Wage Tracker excluding one-offs, real 3-month momentum | Three-month change in real negotiated wage pressure excluding one-off payments. | ECB EWT + EA HICP | 151 | 1.000 | 0.153 | Momentum captures acceleration in real negotiated wage pressure and is useful for signal-timing checks. |
| compensation | diagnostic_short_sample | ecb_ces_real_income_expectations_12m_median | ECB CES real household income expectations | Weighted median expected household income growth over the next 12 months minus HICP inflation. | ECB CES | 43 | 1.000 | 0.952 | Monthly household income-pressure expectations are observable, but the public aggregate sample starts late. |
| compensation | diagnostic_short_sample | ecb_ces_unemployment_expectations_12m_median | ECB CES expected unemployment rate | Weighted median expected unemployment rate over the next 12 months. | ECB CES | 43 | 1.000 | -0.960 | Monthly household labor-market expectations are useful as a short-window expectation diagnostic. |
| compensation | indirect | eurostat_ecfin_eei_ea20 | European Commission employment expectations indicator | Monthly euro-area employment expectations indicator over the next three months. | Eurostat/DG ECFIN BCS | 250 | 1.000 | -0.053 | Timely monthly expected-employment pressure proxy from harmonised business surveys. |
| compensation | indirect | eurostat_ecfin_services_employment_expectations_ea20 | European Commission services employment expectations | Monthly euro-area services employment expectations balance. | Eurostat/DG ECFIN BCS | 250 | 1.000 | -0.048 | Monthly services-sector employment expectations add a services wage-pressure timing proxy. |
| compensation | indirect | eurostat_labor_tightness_unemployment_inv | Eurostat unemployment inverse labor-tightness proxy | Negative of the monthly seasonally adjusted euro-area unemployment rate. | Eurostat LFS | 250 | 1.000 | -0.057 | True monthly labor-tightness proxy; higher transformed value means lower unemployment and tighter labor markets. |
| compensation | robustness | eurostat_sts_industry_wage_bill_de_real_yoy | Eurostat German industry wage bill, real annual growth | Monthly gross wages and salaries index for German industry, deflated by German HICP annual inflation. | Eurostat STS | 238 | 1.000 | 0.313 | True monthly wage-bill series; adds a hard observed payroll-cost proxy, but only for German industry. |
| compensation | robustness | ecb_wage_tracker_headline_real_yoy | ECB Wage Tracker headline, real | Monthly real negotiated wage pressure including smoothed one-off payments. | ECB EWT | 154 | 1.000 | 0.731 | Monthly negotiated wage signal including smoothed one-off payments; useful robustness around the canonical wage tracker. |
| compensation | robustness | ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy_ma3 | ECB Wage Tracker excluding one-offs, real 3-month average | Three-month average of monthly real negotiated wage pressure excluding one-off payments. | ECB EWT + EA HICP | 154 | 1.000 | 0.719 | Rolling real wage-pressure proxy smooths month-specific noise without fabricating observations. |
| compensation | robustness | ecb_wage_tracker_unsmoothed_oneoffs_real_yoy | ECB Wage Tracker with unsmoothed one-off payments, real | Monthly real negotiated wage pressure including unsmoothed one-off payments. | ECB EWT | 154 | 1.000 | 0.730 | Real monthly wage tracker, but one-off payments make it a noisier compensation proxy. |
| housing | canonical | ecb_house_purchase_growth_yoy | ECB lending for house purchase, annual growth | Monthly growth in MFI loans for house purchase; housing-finance transmission. | ECB BSI | 250 | 1.000 | 0.018 | Direct monthly housing-finance series with full sample coverage; it proxies mortgage-credit transmission, not house prices themselves. |
| housing | robustness | ln_ecb_house_purchase_pure_new_loans | ECB pure new loans for house purchase | Monthly flow of pure new house-purchase loans; mortgage-origination transmission. | ECB MIR | 99 | 1.000 | 0.763 | Direct housing-finance flow, but available only from 2017-08 in the pulled ECB vintage. |

## Retained Limitations

| variable | retained_limitations |
| --- | --- |
| ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy | It is negotiated wage pressure, not observed total compensation per employee, payroll income, welfare, or redistribution. |
| ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy_momentum_3m | Momentum is mechanically noisier than the level and is not used as the primary compensation proxy. |
| ecb_ces_real_income_expectations_12m_median | Short public CES sample makes it unsuitable as a canonical long-window compensation proxy. |
| ecb_ces_unemployment_expectations_12m_median | Short sample and expectation construct prevent canonical compensation use. |
| eurostat_ecfin_eei_ea20 | Survey expectations are indirect wage-pressure evidence and can revise with seasonal adjustment. |
| eurostat_ecfin_services_employment_expectations_ea20 | It captures expected services employment, not observed services wages. |
| eurostat_labor_tightness_unemployment_inv | Labor tightness is an indirect wage-pressure proxy, not compensation or wage growth. |
| eurostat_sts_industry_wage_bill_de_real_yoy | Sector/geography are narrow; the series measures wage bill, not compensation per employee. |
| ecb_wage_tracker_headline_real_yoy | One-off treatment can mechanically change short-horizon wage dynamics. |
| ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy_ma3 | Smoothing is transparent and only uses observed current/past monthly data; it is not a distinct source series. |
| ecb_wage_tracker_unsmoothed_oneoffs_real_yoy | Noisier one-off payments reduce persistence interpretability. |
| ecb_house_purchase_growth_yoy | It is a credit-growth proxy, not a direct affordability, price, rent, or welfare measure. |
| ln_ecb_house_purchase_pure_new_loans | Short sample beginning in 2017 limits regime and pre-QE comparisons. |

| compensation | core negotiated wage pressure outside ex-one-offs |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | the available monthly core-like EWT measure is the excluding-one-offs series; no additional official core EWT series is exposed |
| compensation | Eurostat services wage bill |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | searched STS services wage-bill dimensions do not return usable euro-area/German monthly observations in the official API query |
| compensation | Eurostat retail wage bill |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | searched STS trade wage-bill dimensions do not return usable euro-area/German monthly observations in the official API query |
| compensation | payroll/employment-income micro proxy |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | no reproducible public monthly official euro-area payroll micro proxy was found |
| compensation | Indeed wage tracker |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | not retained because the public official-source reproducibility standard is not met |

| compensation | monthly compensation per employee |  | rejected_unavailable_or_nonmonthly | not available as a real monthly series in local or pulled official sources |

## Validation Criteria

Each candidate is scored on economic relevance, monthly continuity, interpretability, response stability to ECB surprises, correlation with the target quarterly construct, subperiod stability, and susceptibility to information-effect contamination. The score is a transparency device, not an automated license to make stronger causal claims.

## Final Proxy Boundary

Accepted housing proxies measure housing finance, not residential prices. Accepted compensation proxies measure negotiated wage pressure, not compensation per employee or welfare. The final empirical claim may compare persistence in housing-finance and wage-pressure responses to ECB surprises, but exact housing-price, compensation, welfare, or redistribution magnitudes remain outside clean identification scope.

## Source Notes

- ECB house-purchase lending growth: `BSI.M.U2.Y.U.A22.A.I.U2.2250.Z01.A`.
- ECB pure new loans for house purchase: `MIR.M.U2.B.A2C.A.B.A.2250.EUR.P`.
- ECB Wage Tracker monthly series: headline `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWS._T.4F0.GY`; excluding one-offs `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWX._T.4F0.GY`; unsmoothed one-offs `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWR._T.4F0.GY`.
- Eurostat labour-cost indicators are quarterly and therefore rejected for the monthly comparison layer.
