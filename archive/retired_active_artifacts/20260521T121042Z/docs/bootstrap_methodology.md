# Bootstrap Methodology

Date: 2026-05-16

The final inference layer keeps HAC/Newey-West intervals and adds dependence-aware bootstrap diagnostics for the monthly reduced-form LPs. The bootstrap is an uncertainty refinement only; it does not change the identified object.

## Methods

- Moving-block bootstrap: residual vectors are resampled in adjacent time blocks using a common draw across horizons for each response.
- Wild bootstrap: residual vectors are multiplied by common Rademacher shocks across horizons, preserving heteroskedasticity-sensitive cross-horizon comovement.
- Automatic block length: `max(6, round(n^(1/3)), min(12, max_horizon / 2))`; sensitivity checks report block lengths 4, 6, 9, 12, and automatic.
- Cumulative intervals: cumulative draws sum bootstrapped horizon coefficients from the same resample path, so horizon dependence is carried into the percentile envelope.

## Interpretation

Bootstrap ribbons and fan charts communicate sampling uncertainty under serial dependence, overlapping horizons, and small monthly samples. They support credibility of persistence comparisons, but they are not new structural estimands.
