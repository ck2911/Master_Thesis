# Information-Effect Screening

Date: 2026-05-16

This screen compares three event-level signs:

- rate-factor sign: `target_factor` when available, otherwise `timing_factor`;
- yield-window sign: `OIS_6M` from the EA-MPD monetary-event window when available;
- equity-window sign: `STOXX50` from the same event window.

Same-sign yield and equity moves are flagged as possible central-bank information shocks. Opposite-sign yield and equity moves are treated as possible pure monetary shocks. Factor-yield sign conflicts and missing/zero market windows are contamination flags, not exclusions by themselves.

## Governance Use

These flags strengthen the exogeneity discussion by identifying events whose market reaction may contain central-bank information or sign-conflict contamination. They do not prove exogeneity, and they do not license stronger structural claims. In the rebuilt pipeline, flagged-event sensitivity should be treated as a robustness screen before any causal language is used.
