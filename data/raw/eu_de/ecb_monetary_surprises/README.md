## Source Notes

- The ABGMR factor files split the policy-decision and communication windows: `target` is in the press-release file; `timing`, `fg`, and `qe` are in the press-conference file.
- The ECB EA-MPD workbook is used for event validation and lightweight Jarocinski-Karadi-style sign screening through `OIS_6M` and `STOXX50` in the monetary-event window.
- The main external instrument is `target_factor_market_magnitude_weighted_quarterly_sum`. Other factors and aggregation rules are used as checks.
