This note records the monthly proxy choices. No quarterly housing or compensation series is turned into artificial monthly data. A proxy is used only when it is observed monthly or transparently constructed from monthly data.

## Main Selections

{markdown_table(canonical, ["side", "variable", "label", "conceptual_object", "source", "sample_start", "sample_end", "monthly_continuity", "quarterly_target_correlation", "horizon_sign_stability", "information_effect_flag", "validation_score"], 10)}

## Accepted Proxies

{markdown_table(accepted, ["side", "role", "variable", "label", "conceptual_object", "source", "observations", "monthly_continuity", "quarterly_target_correlation", "decision_reason"], 20)}

## Retained Limitations

{markdown_table(accepted, ["variable", "retained_limitations"], 20)}

## Rejected Or Unavailable Proxies

{markdown_table(rejected, ["side", "label", "variable", "decision", "decision_reason"], 40)}

## Selection Criteria

Each candidate is scored on economic relevance, monthly continuity, interpretability, response stability, correlation with the lower-frequency target, subperiod stability, and sensitivity to information-effect events. The score helps document measurement choices; it is not a mechanical claim filter.

## Interpretation Boundary

Accepted housing proxies measure housing finance, not residential prices. Accepted compensation proxies measure negotiated wage pressure, not compensation per employee or welfare. The final empirical claim may compare persistence in housing-finance and wage-pressure responses to ECB surprises, but exact housing-price, compensation, welfare, or redistribution magnitudes remain outside clean identification scope.

## Source Notes

- ECB house-purchase lending growth: `BSI.M.U2.Y.U.A22.A.I.U2.2250.Z01.A`.
- ECB pure new loans for house purchase: `MIR.M.U2.B.A2C.A.B.A.2250.EUR.P`.
- ECB Wage Tracker monthly series: headline `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWS._T.4F0.GY`; excluding one-offs `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWX._T.4F0.GY`; unsmoothed one-offs `EWT.M.U2.N.WT.INWR._T.4F0.GY`.
- Eurostat labour-cost indicators are quarterly and therefore rejected for the monthly comparison layer.

This note explains the monthly compensation-side measures. Every retained proxy is observed monthly or is a transparent transformation of monthly data.

## Main Compensation Selection

{markdown_table(canonical, ["rank", "canonical_status", "variable", "label", "role", "source", "compensation_proxy_score", "residual_limitation"], 12)}

The main compensation proxy is `ecb_wage_tracker_ex_oneoffs_real_yoy`: nominal ECB negotiated wage pressure excluding one-off payments minus HICP inflation. It is selected because it is the most interpretable monthly wage-pressure measure for persistent compensation dynamics, even when the mechanical scorecard ranks the narrower German industry wage-bill proxy higher on shock sensitivity.

The secondary check is `eurostat_sts_industry_wage_bill_de_real_yoy`. It is a hard observed monthly wage-bill indicator and therefore valuable as a payroll-cost check, but it is not the main proxy because its German industry scope is narrower than the euro-area negotiated-wage concept.

No composite index is selected. The available candidates measure different constructs, and combining negotiated wages, sector wage bills, labor-market tightness, and expectations would obscure the measurement boundary more than it would strengthen it. The 3-month wage-tracker average remains a transparent noise-control check, not a new source series.

## Full Ranking

{markdown_table(rankings, ["rank", "variable", "label", "role", "source", "canonical_status", "compensation_proxy_score", "directional_consistency", "cumulative_persistence", "hac_p10_horizon_share", "bootstrap_sign_stability_h6", "contamination_flag", "frequency_integrity"], 30)}

## Rejected Or Diagnostic-Only Candidates

{markdown_table(rejections, ["label", "variable", "decision", "decision_reason"], 40)}

## Selection Logic

The scorecard evaluates frequency, coverage, stationarity, persistence, sign consistency, regime stability, bootstrap checks, economic interpretation, clean-event sensitivity, and noise. The ranking documents measurement quality rather than searching for significance.

## Residual Limitations

Even the best monthly compensation proxies are not observed monthly compensation per employee. ECB wage trackers measure negotiated wage pressure, STS wage-bill data are sector/geography narrower, and CES income expectations have a short public sample. The thesis can compare financial-transmission persistence with wage-pressure persistence, but it cannot claim exact compensation, welfare, or redistribution magnitudes.
